   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to ACon Sumo openCV's documentation!

text
================
The area of a circle is :math:`A_\text{c} = (\pi/4) d^2`.

This is a typical paragraph.  An indented literal block follows.

::

    for a in [5,4,3,2,1]:   # this is program code, shown as-is
        print a
    print "it's..."
    # a literal block continues until the indentation ends

This text has returned to the indentation of the first paragraph,
is outside of the literal block, and is therefore treated as an
ordinary paragraph.

.. _my-reference-label:

Section to cross-reference
--------------------------

This is the text of the section.

It refers to the section itself, see :ref:`my-reference-label`.
